# Project - 1.0

This was a project made for a web design course, I honestly have no idea about what it is supposed to be lol. <br />
<br />
I Was trying to achieve the requested criteria, and this is what I - we in this case - got.

# Usage

First of all, install dependencies

* *Prettier tailwind plugin will be installed - if you don't wish to use it, remove it from the dependencies in the package.json file*

```
npm i
```

Then run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run watch
```

Alternatively, to run a one time build

```
